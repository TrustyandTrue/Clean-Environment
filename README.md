# Clean-Environment

An android app to monitor the realtime weather and air pollution throughout the world by using sensors in cars

# Description of the Application

Our project was to build an android app to monitor the air pollution and weather conditions around the world by using sensors in cars which could be extended to public transports as well. Right now, itâ€™s possible to get air pollution and weather data from only the stationary points in the city. Air pollution data from mobile nodes has not been implemented in the industry
yet. 

We would like to use pollution sensors, gas sensors, flame sensors, temperature sensors and precipitation sensors in order to get the real time data at each node of a city. The data we obtain from here can be used for further data mining applications like if there are two factories operating in a particular area, we would be able to use the data to see the pollution level and deduce whether they can be operated at different times. The challenges lie in processing huge parallel streams of big data and updating to a centralized database using algorithms to deduce which data should be updated.
